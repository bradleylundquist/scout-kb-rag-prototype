# Scout KB – RAG Prototype

Early-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine for Scout KB.

## Goal
Build a grounded document Q&A system that:
- Ingests documents (TXT → PDF/DOC later)
- Chunks content
- Embeds and stores locally
- Retrieves relevant chunks
- Generates answers strictly grounded in uploaded content

## Status
Milestone A – Ingestion + Chunking + Local Storage

## Run (Planned)
1. Create virtual environment
2. Install requirements
3. Ingest sample docs
4. Query documents
